MangaReader 📖

MangaReader is a high-performance, lightweight manga and comic viewer built in Rust. Designed specifically for the Windows environment, it focuses on providing a fluid, lag-free reading experience through aggressive preloading and native rendering.
⚡ Why MangaReader?

    Built for Speed: Uses a dual-buffer system to preload upcoming and previous pages in the background, ensuring near-instant page turns.

    Windows Optimized: Leverages Windows-native natural alphanumeric sorting (so "Page 2" actually comes before "Page 10") and high-performance rendering.

    Smart Scaling: Includes multiple resampling algorithms (from "Fast" Nearest Neighbor to "High Quality" Lanczos3) to make every scan look its best on your monitor.

    Tailored Reading: Supports Single Page, Double Page (Left-to-Right), and Double Page (Right-to-Left) modes, including a "Cover + Spreads" shift toggle.

MangaReader handles both compressed archives and raw file structures seamlessly.
